Welcome to CSUM HAM Messaging System's documentation!
=====================================================

This module will be integrated into the UHF Telemetry, Tracking, and Command (TT&C) subsystem of CSUM satellites to enable members of the Amateur Radio Community world wide to exchange messages through CSUM satellite missions.

The purpose of this project is to involve HAM Radio members in the development and testing of this application. In this context, Amateur Radio enthusiasts are more than welcome to join the project whether by directly contributing to the development of the source code or by sharing ideas to improve the application as a whole.
